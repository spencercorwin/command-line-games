# Command Line Games

A few command-line games using Typescript and TS-Node. For now just Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four.

To play either game clone this repository then run `yarn install` or `npm install`. Then run `ts-node connect-four.ts` to play a game of Connect Four or run `ts-node tic-tac-toe.ts` to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game will stop when there is a winner. Enter `Ctrl-C` to terminate the game.
